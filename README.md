# OSLab
This repo contains the code written for Operating Systems Lab (CS39002) course.
Assgn 1 - 4 are individual assignments, Assgn 5, 6 were in groups of two.
All the code written is in C.
Each assignment folder also contains code samples (provided by the professor) in a separate folder, along with the problem statement.

Assignments 5 and 6 were based on [pintos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos). Owing to the large file structure of pintos, only the modified/added files has been pushed. Reports for these assignments have also been added.
